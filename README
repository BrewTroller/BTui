//   BTUI -- A JavaScript/HTML5 User Interface For the BrewTroller Project
//   				www.BrewTroller.com

App is in ALPHA Stage!

You must set the IP of the btnic module in the settings window

The BTUI.tmproj file is a project file for the TextMate text editor for Mac,
which I beleive is also compatible with the 'E' editor for Windows


Currently Implemented:
	
	Vessel Volume and Temperature retrieval from BrewTroller
	Manual Vessel Updates
	Auto Updates with configurable interval
	
To DO:

	get/set set points from/to BrewTroller
	Valve profile refactoring / synchronizing with BrewTroller
	Implement full settings from BrewTroller Menus
	Add CSS code to build a theme, and make the appearance pretty :)
	
App is based on the ExtJS 4 library, available at http://sencha.com
	
Currently All communication with the BrewTroller is done using JavaScript and XHR GET requests instead of using the Flash based transfers in the YUI library (Matt's initial Demo used it). This provided maximum compatibility with devices, but because JavaScript is Single threaded it can quickly slow down or crash the browser if the Auto Update frequency is set too high. The next version of the BTNic module firmware providing batch commands will help this problem considerably.
