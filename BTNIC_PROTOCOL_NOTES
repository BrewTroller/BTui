Get Temperature -- q
	When no temp sensor address has been defined for a 'zone' BT reports the temperature as 442949345.28 degrees
	-- Currently as a fail-safe, the UI reports a temperature of 0 when it receives this, but it could be used to detect when there has been no sensor defined for a 'zone'
	
Get SetPoint -- t
	Implementation for get SetPoint and set SetPoint are inconsistent with their Temperature counterpart. Calling btnic.cgi?q1 might return a value of 3190 for 31.90 degrees, whereas calling btnic.cgi?t0 would return a value of 31, assuming the set point is 31 degrees and the vessel has overshot its set point by .90 degrees. 
	
Reset -- c
	Implementation of Reset Level 0 (tested using BT4.0 with v2.4 r761) causes board to Hard-lock, requiring power cycle to regain responsiveness. Reset Level 1 (soft reboot) works as expected.
	
Set Valve Profile Status -- b
	EXAMPLE --> 
		User 1 profile:
			From architecture wiki, User 1 bit mask = 131072
			to Activate   --> http://address/btnic.cgi?b&131072&1
			to DeActivate --> http://address/btnic.cgi?b&131072&0
			
Set/Get Output Settings -- D / N	(HAS BUG!)

	From wiki, the parameter for PID Cycle time should be set and received in units of Seconds, but it is actually done in tenths of seconds
		EXAMPLE -->
			If we have the PID cycle time for the HLT set to 1.0 seconds on the BT (checked via LCD) and call http://address/btnic.cgi?D0
			we would expect to receive a response like ["timestamp", "D0", "HEATTYPE", "1", "PGAIN", "IGAIN", "DGAIN", "HYSTERESIS"]
			but in reality we receive ["timestamp", "D0", "HEATTYPE", "10", "PGAIN", "IGAIN", "DGAIN", "HYSTERESIS", "UNKNOWN", "UNKNOWN"]
			
	Also from wiki, the N command requires 6 parameters, but if you pass the N command with only 6 parameters the BT will return "#", "N0" indicating invalid parameters
	in order to use the N command you must pass it 8 parameters, of which the last two have unknown functions.
